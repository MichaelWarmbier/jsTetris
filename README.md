# jsTetris

Tetris redesigned from scratch in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description

This web-based game is a continuation of my "Console Tetris" project and was used as a gateway into practicing somet HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Code was written from scratch with the only reference being the code from the afforementioned "Console Tetris".

## Filesystem

The files in the project are stored in a basic root folder intended to be hosted as a website. Hosted within www.michaelwarmbier.com. It can be run locally by downloading the files and running "index.html" using a html viewer like Chrome.
